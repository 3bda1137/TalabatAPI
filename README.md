# API Talapat

API Talapat is a project developed with the onion architecture pattern using .NET Core to provide a robust and scalable API solution.

## Introduction

API Talapat aims to provide a flexible and maintainable API solution by adhering to the principles of the onion architecture. This architecture pattern promotes separation of concerns, making the codebase easier to understand, test, and extend.

## Features

- **Modular Design**: The project is divided into layers, including core application logic, infrastructure, and interfaces, enabling easier maintenance and testing.
- **Testability**: With the separation of concerns, individual components can be tested independently, leading to better test coverage and overall quality.
- **Flexibility**: The architecture allows for easy swapping of components, such as data access layers or external services, without affecting the core business logic.
- **Scalability**: By decoupling components, the application can scale more effectively, both vertically and horizontally.

## Architecture Overview

The onion architecture consists of the following layers:

1. **Core Domain**: Contains the core business logic and domain models. This layer is independent of any external frameworks or technologies.
2. **Application Services**: Implements the application-specific logic, orchestrating interactions between the core domain and external interfaces.
3. **Infrastructure**: Provides implementations for data access, external services, and other infrastructure-related concerns. This layer communicates with external systems and resources.
4. **Interfaces**: Includes the user interfaces or APIs through which clients interact with the application. This layer is responsible for handling requests, serializing/deserializing data, and presenting responses.
